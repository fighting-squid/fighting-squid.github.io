								<h2>Bi-directional, bi-functional, by design<br />
								</h2>
								<p>Built from polycarbonate, sheet metal, aluminum, and blood sweat and tears, this robot was designed to have bilateral symmetry to drive forwards or backwards. Every mechanical component except the motors, nuts and bolts was designed in SolidWorks and CNC machined.</p>

								<p>Two multiplexing circuits receive signals from 6 IR-beacon sensors in addition to 10 QRD tape-following sensors. IR signals are filtered post-multiplexer by a sample and hold circuit, giving a 3ms respond time per sensor. This lets us check each IR sensor 5 times a second durinng contest play</p>

								<h2>Event detection driven robot behavior with path planning<br />
								</h2>
								<p>The Fighting Squid has several control modes it enters depending on environmental cues - a passenger pickup, drop-off, collision, etc. In the background, the Squid plans the shortest route between two nodes and updates this route as events unfold (collisions, pickups etc).</p>
