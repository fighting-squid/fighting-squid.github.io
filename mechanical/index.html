<h2> Mechanical Design</h2>
<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Front-View-2.jpg" alt="the Team" /></div></center>

	<p> Mechanical components for the robot were designed in SolidWorks and produced using CNC machining via waterjet cutter and lasercutter. The overall design of the robot is bi-directional, to reduce the time required to turn around. As a result our robot is mechanically symmetric about its drive axle, which is located at the center of the robot chassis. Two unpowered wheels at front and back provide a 4-point base for stability.
