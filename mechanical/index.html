<h2> Mechanical Design</h2>

	<p> Mechanical components for the robot were designed in SolidWorks and produced using CNC machining via waterjet cutter and lasercutter. The overall design of the robot is bi-directional, to reduce the time required to turn around. As a result our robot is mechanically symmetric about its drive axle, which is located at the center of the robot chassis. Two unpowered wheels at front and back provide a 4-point base for stability.

	<p> The arm pickup mechanism consists of two one-degree of freedom arms which share a common base, and each have a servo-actuated grabbing claw. </p>
