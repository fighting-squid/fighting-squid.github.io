								<h2>Sensor Layout<br/>
								</h2>
								<p>We designed a functionally symmetrical sensor layout, which allows our robot to be fully aware of its surroundings, in both directions. The QRD sensors, used to determine the position of the tape on the course, allow our robot to drive down the roads, as well as detect and navigate through intersections. The passenger IR sensors enable our robot to both detection passengers from a distance, and to accurately align to them for pickup. Our robot knows when it is next to the drop-off zone through the use of elevated IR sensors. Mechanical switches allow our robot to back off from collisions with other robots.</p>

								<h2>Analog Multiplexing<br/>
								</h2>
								<p>The TINAH Board used in our robot only has eight analog I/O pins, but our sensor layout calls for 18 analog inputs. To solve this problem, we decided to use multiplexing ICs. The multiplexing configuration was designed in a way that multiplexed between sensors that do not need to be read at the same time.</p>

								<h2>IR Sensor Mount<br/>
								</h2>
								<p>In order to grab the passengers, we have to align our robot with the IR-emitting base they rest on. However, our IR sensors measure in an angle of twenty degrees, which is too wide to align the grabbing arm. To solve this problem, we designed and 3D-printed an IR mount, which physically restricts the detection angle of the short-range passenger IR sensors, allowing our robot to accurately align itself with and pick up the passenger. The mount also holds the long-range passenger sensors.</p>
